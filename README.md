## About

This plugin is basically just an AngularJS port of the original jQuery bootstrap calendar that can be found here:
http://bootstrap-calendar.azurewebsites.net/

The layout and functionality is intended to be exactly the same, but without the overhead of including jQuery just for a calendar. 

All credits for the UI/UX of the calendar go to the original author.

Pull requests more than welcome.
